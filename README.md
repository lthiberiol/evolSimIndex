Assess evolutionary similarity between gene families

## Overview
Evolutionary Similarity Index ( <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_{ES}">) is a metric for evolutionary similarity between gene families. It is the product of $I_{ES}=R^{2}*I_{BC}$.

* $R^2$: is the coefficient of determination from an weighted Orthogonal Distance Regression

* $I_{BC}$: is $1-D_{BC}$, where $D_{BC}$ is the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between two gene families.

$I_{ES}$ is less susceptible to phylogenetic noise than its tree-based counterparts, and more computationally efficient given that it bypasses tree reconstruction.
